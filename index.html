        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="Headshot.JPG" alt="Zachary Hooks" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 15%; border-radius: 10px;">
        <p class="bio-text">    Recently graduated BBA with a major in Computer Information Systems through Texas State University. I'm currently seeking a full-time position in Data Analytics or a respective Information Technology role. With two years of experience in Python, SQL, and Agile methodologies with hands-on experience in AI-driven automation, I aim to contribute analytical and technical expertise to help drive data-driven decisions and improve IT systems. I'm currently furthering my education in data analysis and visualization through UT's online boot camp. Learning to apply hands-on skills in data analysis using Python, Excel, SQL, Tableau and other key tools, as well as working with real-world datasets to uncover insights and trends, preparing for data-driven decision-making roles.</p>
        <p class="bio-text">    My experience as a Client Solutions Specialist with the ITAC team further solidified my passion for IT. Working closely with clients, I gained invaluable insight into the lengths IT professionals go to not only resolve issues but also document and research the root causes to prevent future occurrences. This proactive approach to problem-solving resonated deeply with me and has become a guiding principle in my work.</p>
        <p class="bio-text">    In addition to my professional and academic experiences, I've been sharpening my automation skills through various Python projects. Whether it's developing automated invoice generation systems or creating data entry tools, I am passionate about understanding not just why these processes are useful but how to get the most out of them to optimize system run-times. These projects have deepened my appreciation for the practical applications of IT and the tangible benefits they can bring to individuals and businesses alike.</p>
        <p class="bio-text">    When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me diving into music (specifically the guitar and bass), or at the gym. I also enjoy spending some quality time with my friends and my dog.</p>
